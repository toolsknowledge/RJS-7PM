State Management
****************
    React applications are component based applications.

    we can create more than one component.

    we can provide the communication between the components.

    we can provide communication between parent component to child component with the help of props.

    we can provide communication between child component to parent component with the help of events.

    if application is large, communication between components are difficult.

    in order to overcome above difficulty we have state Management in React.

    by using state Management we can maintain common data at client side.

    this common data available to all components.

    reading the data from common place called as subscription.

    updating the data to the common place called as dispatch

    to implement state Management we have redux library.
