Variables
=========
    - variables are used to store the data.

            Ex.
                string
                number
                boolean
                arrays
                objects
                ---
                ---
                ---

    - we will declare variables by using "var" , "let" or "const".

    - both "let" and "const" keywords introduced in "ES6".

    - variables should contain a-z , A-Z, 0-9, $ and _

    - variables should not start with digits.

Syntax
======
    var / let / const variablename = value;



=> string

=> number

=> boolean

=> undefined

=> null

=> bigint

=> Symbol


string
======
    collection of characters called as "string".

    we will represent string in 3 ways.

            1) "" (double quotes)

            2) '' (single quotes)

            3) `` (backtick operator)

    `` (backtick operator) introduced in "ES6".

    `` (backtick operator) used to define the "paragraphs"


function
========
    - particular business logic called as function

    - functions are used to "reuse" the business logic

    - we will define functions by using "function" keyword


Syntax
======
    //function definition
    function functionname(arg1,arg2,arg3,....argn){
        //business logic
    }

    //call the function
    functionname(param1,param2,param3,param4,.....paramn);



TypeScript
==========
    - TypeScript is the "programming" language.

    - TypeScript given by "microsoft".

    - "superset" of javascript also called as "TypeScript".

    - TypeScript follows the "OOPS".

    - TypeScript used to build the Angular,React,Node,VueJS,.....

    - we will save TypeScript files ".ts" extension.

    - in general, browsers can't understand TypeScript

    - so, we must convert TypeScript to equalent javascript.

    - conversion from TypeScript to equalent javascript called as "transpilation".

    - "tsc" is the tool, used to perform the transpilation.

    - "tsc" stands for TypeScript Compiler.


installation of TypeScript
==========================

> npm install -g typescript

    npm stands for node packaging manager

    -g stands for global installation.


Transpilation
=============
   > tsc demo.ts
         o/p
    demo.js

    > node demo.js
