Variables
=========
    - variables are used to store the data.

            Ex.
                string
                number
                boolean
                arrays
                objects
                ---
                ---
                ---

    - we will declare variables by using "var" , "let" or "const".

    - both "let" and "const" keywords introduced in "ES6".

    - variables should contain a-z , A-Z, 0-9, $ and _

    - variables should not start with digits.

Syntax
======
    var / let / const variablename = value;



=> string

=> number

=> boolean

=> undefined

=> null

=> bigint

=> Symbol


string
======
    collection of characters called as "string".

    we will represent string in 3 ways.

            1) "" (double quotes)

            2) '' (single quotes)

            3) `` (backtick operator)

    `` (backtick operator) introduced in "ES6".

    `` (backtick operator) used to define the "paragraphs"


function
========
    - particular business logic called as function

    - functions are used to "reuse" the business logic

    - we will define functions by using "function" keyword


Syntax
======
    //function definition
    function functionname(arg1,arg2,arg3,....argn){
        //business logic
    }

    //call the function
    functionname(param1,param2,param3,param4,.....paramn);
